Alignment Strategies:

Ideally, unmethylated Cs are identified when the
reads are aligned to the reference genomes. However, bisulfite conversion raises two
major computational challenges of data alignment: asymmetrical C-T alignment and
reduced sequence complexity. Asymmetrical C-T alignment refers to the possibility of T
alignment in sequencing reads to C in reference genomes and not vice versa [34]. Reduced
sequence complexity makes it difficult to distinguish converted Ts from system errors,
which exaggerates the inexact alignments

Studies that propose three-letter aligners, such as Bismark and BWA-METH, outperformed command
wildcard aligners, such as BRAT_BW, BSMAP, and GSnap in running
time and peak memory usage.
